# Guessing Game
My first app written on Rust. The app is simply a game for guessing numbers.
Use ***cargo run*** to execute the game

How it works: the program generates a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the
player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is
too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and
exit.
